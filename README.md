# Experimental Evaluation of Network Anomaly Identification System

## Project Overview

This project presents an experimental evaluation of a Machine Learning-based Network Anomaly Detection System using the NSL-KDD dataset.

The system detects abnormal network traffic patterns and classifies potential intrusions using both unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques.

# Web-Based Security Dashboard Interface

This project includes a fully interactive web-based Network Security Dashboard built using Streamlit.

The dashboard transforms the anomaly detection system into a user-friendly application suitable for both technical and non-technical users.

## Dashboard Features

The interface allows users to:

- Upload training and testing datasets using drag-and-drop
- Perform real-time anomaly detection
- View Network Safety Score using an interactive gauge meter
- Analyze traffic distribution using a modern donut chart
- See clear SAFE / LOW RISK / HIGH RISK status indicators
- View confusion matrix and model accuracy (Advanced Mode)
- Analyze feature importance visualization
- Filter traffic by predicted attack type
- Identify high-risk records
- Explore dataset in tabular format
- Download full security analysis report (CSV)
- Secure access via login authentication
- Switch between Beginner Mode and Advanced Mode

-Streamlit-Authenticator

This interface transforms the anomaly detection model into a professional-grade, interactive security intelligence dashboard suitable for academic, research, and demonstration purposes.

## Datasets Used

This project uses the NSL-KDD benchmark dataset, which improves upon the original KDD'99 dataset by removing redundant records.

Included dataset files:

- KDDTrain+
- KDDTest+
- Train_data.csv
- Test_data.csv

### Attack Categories Covered

- Normal Traffic  
- Denial of Service (DoS)  
- Probe  
- Remote to Local (R2L)  
- User to Root (U2R)

---

## Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing

- Parsing raw NSL-KDD data  
- One-hot encoding of categorical features  
- Feature selection  
- Data normalization  

### 2. Machine Learning Models

- Isolation Forest (Unsupervised Anomaly Detection)  
- Random Forest (Supervised Classification)  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  

Isolation Forest identifies anomalies by detecting data points that are isolated from normal traffic patterns.
