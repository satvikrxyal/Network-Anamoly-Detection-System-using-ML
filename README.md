# Experimental Evaluation of Network Anomaly Identification System

## Project Overview

This project presents an experimental evaluation of a Machine Learning-based Network Anomaly Detection System using the NSL-KDD dataset.

The system detects abnormal network traffic patterns and classifies potential intrusions using both unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques.

---

## Datasets Used

This project uses the NSL-KDD benchmark dataset, which improves upon the original KDD'99 dataset by removing redundant records.

Included dataset files:

- KDDTrain+
- KDDTest+
- Train_data.csv
- Test_data.csv

### Attack Categories Covered

- Normal Traffic  
- Denial of Service (DoS)  
- Probe  
- Remote to Local (R2L)  
- User to Root (U2R)

---

## Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing

- Parsing raw NSL-KDD data  
- One-hot encoding of categorical features  
- Feature selection  
- Data normalization  

### 2. Machine Learning Models

- Isolation Forest (Unsupervised Anomaly Detection)  
- Random Forest (Supervised Classification)  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  

Isolation Forest identifies anomalies by detecting data points that are isolated from normal traffic patterns.
